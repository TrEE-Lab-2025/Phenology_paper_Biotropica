Calculate the threshold for year 2018
```{r}
# read the file
mydata_2018 = read.csv("Kaas_Phenology_2018.csv")

# Calculate community threshold for each census
thresholds <- sapply(mydata_2018[, -c(1:5)], function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) + 1.64*(sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)))
print(thresholds)  # This prints a vector of thresholds for each of the six census readings

# Now, for each species (each row), check if its density in any one census exceeds the corresponding threshold
mydata_2018$HighDensity <- apply(mydata_2018[, -c(1:5)], 1, function(x) any(x >= thresholds))


# List of species that are defined as high density flowering for that year
high_density_species <- mydata_2018$Flowering_species[mydata_2018$HighDensity]
print(high_density_species)


#Save the output
write.csv(mydata_2018, file = "highdensity_sp_2018.csv")

Calculate the threshold for year 2019

Calculate the threshold for year 2020
