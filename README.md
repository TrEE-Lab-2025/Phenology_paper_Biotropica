This repository includes codes for the following analyses:
1. Phenology: Classification of species into mass-flowering and non-mass-flowering species based on their flowering density.
2. Phenology: Visualisation of the three-year-long flowering phenology observations.
3. Flowering synchrony: Calculation of SItemp and SIabd as discussed in the manuscript.
